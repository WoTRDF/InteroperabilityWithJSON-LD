# InteroperabilityWithJSON-LD
Here we present JSON-LD descriptions of IoT entities from three IoT infrastructures, e.g., FIWARE, openHAB, and Netatmo, as illustrated in the following figure.

We provide native XML/JSON descriptions about entities/devices from three IoT infrastructures. We also provide the semantically enriched descriptions by use of JSON-LD.

Furthermore, we define a Cross Domain Ontology by extending OneM2M base ontology to define common concepts (e.g., thing vs device, location, time, name, attribute) shared by all sub domains of IoT, which is used in our JSON-LD descriptions.
The next figure illustrates a RDF graph showing how the entities from the three IoT infrastructures can potentially be linked through semantics.
